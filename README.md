# Fruit Recommender

Fruit Recommender is a simple research program that records users and the fruits they choose during its operation. In its output, a recommendation is made for a user N based on the similarity between N users, exploring the concept of using limits and derivatives for this purpose.

## Available Languages

- Go (go1.20.7+)
- C

## Program Execution

In different languages, the execution process changes according to the assignments established by their developers. I recommend that you use the following commands below for the language you chose to use:

> After cloning the repository and choosing the language, make sure you have correctly installed the necessary components for the compiler or interpreter of the language you are using so that errors do not occur.

### Golang

To compile and run the same file directly:
```go
go run main.go
```
Or if you prefer to compile separately, run it in your terminal:
```go
go build main.go
./main
```
### C

> Please note that the C version is a small adaptation of the official code written Go, so if you find bugs, please let me know.

To compile in C, use the command below, as it uses a mathematical library and cannot be executed without arguments via the terminal.

```go
gcc recommender.c -o recommender -lm
./recommender
```

## The program research

I chose the topic “The Use of Limits and Derivatives to Improve Recommendation Algorithms on Streaming Platforms” in my Applied Calculus I academic seminar because I wanted to understand in more depth how recommendation algorithms work within the main streaming platforms that we use daily. It was a rich process, as I was able to understand and work directly with the subject, evolving my mathematical and programming skills as a computer scientist.
